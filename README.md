### What is C Programming?

C programming is a powerful, general-purpose language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. Known for its efficiency and control, C allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory, making it ideal for system-level programming. It serves as the foundation for many other languages like C++, Java, and Python. C is widely used in developing operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, and game development. Its portability and performance make it a popular choice for building high-performance applications, device drivers, network programming, and software for embedded systems.

### Applications of C Programming
* Operating Systems (e.g., UNIX)
* Embedded Systems
* Game Development
* System Software (e.g., Compilers, Interpreters)
* Network Programming
* Database Management Systems (DBMS)
* Graphics and GUI Development
* Device Drivers

### C Dependencies
In C programming, dependencies refer to external files, libraries, or modules that a program needs to compile and run, such as header files, standard libraries, and third-party libraries. Managing dependencies ensures that all required components are available during the build process. The compiler translates C source code into machine code, resolving dependencies by including necessary files and linking libraries. 

### Compiler
[gcc_compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is used in translating the source code into machine code.
